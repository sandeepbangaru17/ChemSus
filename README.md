## Features

### 🔐 Authentication (Supabase)

* **Email/Password** sign up and login
* **Google OAuth** login
* **Role-based access** — a specific admin email gets redirected to the admin dashboard; all other users go to the homepage
* **JWT-protected API** — admin routes require valid Supabase JWT with matching admin email
* **Auto-updating navbar** — shows "Log In / Sign Up" or "Logout (email)" based on auth state across all pages

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root (see `.env.example`):

```env
# Supabase (required)
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com

# Optional — Email OTP for order verification
OTP_SMTP_HOST=smtp.your-provider.com
OTP_SMTP_PORT=587
OTP_SMTP_SECURE=false
OTP_SMTP_USER=your_smtp_user
OTP_SMTP_PASS=your_smtp_password
OTP_EMAIL_FROM=no-reply@yourdomain.com
OTP_HASH_SECRET=change_this_secret
OTP_TTL_MIN=15
OTP_RESEND_SEC=60
OTP_MAX_ATTEMPTS=5
OTP_TOKEN_TTL_MIN=30
```

Supabase values come from **Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API**.

## Database Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `products_page` | Product catalogue cards |
| `shop_items` | Shop items with pricing |
| `pack_pricing` | Pack sizes and tiered pricing |
| `orders` | Customer orders (with `order_status` and `payment_status`) |
| `order_items` | Order line items |
| `payments` | Payment records and receipts |
| `site_settings` | Brochure URL and site configuration |
| `email_otp_sessions` | Email OTP sessions for checkout verification |

Database auto-migrates on startup — new columns (`order_status`, etc.) and indexes are added automatically.

## How to Run

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Set up Supabase

1. Create a project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Copy your **Project URL** and **anon key** from Settings → API
3. Paste them into `public/assets/js/supabase-client.js`
4. Enable **Email** provider in Authentication → Providers
5. (Optional) Enable **Google** provider with your OAuth credentials
6. Add your site URL to Authentication → URL Configuration

### 3. Configure environment

```bash
# Create .env file
echo ADMIN_EMAIL=your-admin@email.com > .env
```

### 4. Start the server

# Development (auto-reload)
npm run dev

# Production
npm start
```

### 5. Open in browser

```
http://localhost:3000
```

## Authentication Flow

1. User visits any page → sidebar shows **"Log In / Sign Up"**
2. Clicks login → redirected to `/login.html`
3. Signs up or logs in with Email/Password or Google
4. **Admin email** → redirected to `/admin/admin.html` (dashboard)
5. **Any other email** → redirected to `/index.html` (homepage)
6. Navbar updates to show **"Logout (email)"** on all pages
7. Admin API calls include `Authorization: Bearer <supabase_jwt>` header

---

## Security

* Admin access controlled by **Supabase JWT + email verification**
* Admin API routes validate JWT token and check email matches `ADMIN_EMAIL`
* User-facing protected routes (`/api/user/orders`) require valid JWT
* File uploads are type-validated
* Static files served only from `public/`
